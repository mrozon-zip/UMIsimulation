The “Generate” module was developed to produce randomized barcode nucleotide sequences, analogous to those commonly utilized in molecular techniques requiring sample identification. The module enables user-defined customization, allowing specification of both the length of individual sequences and the total number of sequences generated. Each nucleotide in a sequence is independently and randomly selected from the set of nucleotides ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T'). To ensure unbiased and statistically valid randomness, Python’s built-in “random” package is employed.
