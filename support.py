    Process mutation over a batch of sequences with possible substitutions, deletions, and insertions.
    Each nucleotide in each parent sequence is checked for mutation.

    If a mutation occurs at a nucleotide:
      - substitution: Replace the nucleotide with a different one.
      - deletion: Remove the nucleotide.
      - insertion: Insert a new nucleotide before the current one.

    Sequences are represented as fixed-length arrays (e.g., with nucleotides as integers 0â€“3),

    The effective (true) sequence length is tracked separately.

    Additionally, if the mutated sequences become longer than the original sequence length,
    the original all_sequences is padded to ensure both arrays have the same number of columns.

    Args:
      parent_ids: CuPy array of shape (N,) with indices into `all_sequences` (selecting the parent sequences).
      all_sequences: CuPy array of shape (num_sequences, seq_len) holding sequences.
